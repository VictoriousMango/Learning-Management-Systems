# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Learning Management System (LMS)
## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for a Learning Management System (LMS) that facilitates online learning, course management, and user administration. The system will support three types of users: Admin, Course Incharge, and Learner, each with distinct roles and access permissions.

### 1.2 Scope
The LMS will provide a platform for educational institutions and corporate training programs. It will allow administrators to manage users, course incharges to create and manage courses, and learners to enroll in and complete courses. The system will include features for course management, user authentication, assessments, and reporting.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
LMS: Learning Management System
Admin: System administrator with full access
Course Incharge: Faculty or instructor responsible for courses
